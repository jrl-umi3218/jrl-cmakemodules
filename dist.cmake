# _SETUP_PROJECT_DIST
# -------------------
#
# Add a dist target to generate a tarball using git-archive.
#
# Linux specific: use git-archive-all.sh to obtain a recursive
# git-archive on the project's submodule.
# Please note that git-archive-all.sh is not carefully written
# and create a temporary file in the source directory
# (which is then moved to the build directory).
